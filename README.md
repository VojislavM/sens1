# I2C Arduino Library for CO₂ Humidity and Temperature Sensor - SCD30
[CO₂ Humidity and Temperature Sensor - SCD30](https://www.sensirion.com/en/environmental-sensors/carbon-dioxide-sensors-co2/)

The SCD30 from Sensirion is a high quality Nondispersive Infrared (NDIR) based CO₂ sensor capable of detecting 400 to 10000ppm with an accuracy of ±(30ppm+3%). In order to improve accuracy the SCD30 has temperature and humidity sensing built-in, as well as commands to set the current altitude. For additional accuracy the SCD30 also accepts ambient pressure readings.

Note: The SCD30 has an automatic self-calibration routine. Sensirion recommends 7 days of continuous readings with at least 1 hour a day of 'fresh air' for self-calibration to complete.

I've written an Arduino library to make CO₂, humidity, and temperature readings easy. Additionaly, settings can be set and read, the sensor can be reset and an external interrupt is possible via the RDY pin. 

There is also an UART version of this library which can be found here: https://github.com/NejcKle/sens2.

The library was written with the help of [SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SCD30_Arduino_Library).
